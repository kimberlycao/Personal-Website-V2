# Personal Website Version 2

This is a personal website for my computer science achievements! I've learned a lot since building my [first website](https://github.com/kimberlycao/kimberlycao.github.io) and am excited to show off what I've learned since then. It's built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
