        Hi everyone! My name is Kimberly and I'm a final year student at the
        University of Toronto and this year's UTM Robotics' projects
        coordinator.
        <br />
        <br />I enjoy attending hackathons and am always looking for ways to add
        to my skillset. My hobbies include baking, hiking and watching reruns of
        The Office.
      </p>
